#ingles [[Real conditional]]

*We’re talking about an imagined future, a hypothetical.*

*If a large dog attacked me, I would put my hands…*

*We use it to talk about unreal conditions and our theoretical result.*

If I won the lottery, I’d become the king.
*I’d = I would*
If the zombie apocalypse started, I’d hide.
I would eat healthy food if I wasn’t lazy.
If I had time, I could conquer the world.
*Can replace would using could*
If the apocalypse started, what would you do?
If I were you, I’d study.
